The goal is to develop a Java console application for managing customers and orders. 
It should allow adding customers and orders, printing customer and order information, 
displaying specific customer and order data, generating bills for customers, and providing an option to exit the program.
The application will utilize object-oriented programming concepts and use ArrayLists to store customer and order data.
